= Custom Bash extensions

This repo contains several bash customizations for my personal use.

== Motivation (s)

. Make my installation of shells quicker
. Play a bit with bash

== Installation

. Place the shell in the user home directory (type `cd`).

. Clone the repo with

 git clone https://github.com/abelsromero/bash-extensions.git ".${USER}_ext"

. Add the following lines to `.profile`, `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` depending on the settup.

 source ~/.${USER}_ext/bootstrap.sh

. Restart the shell or run `source .profile` (or `.bashrc`).

If all is fine, you should see the new shell layout.
